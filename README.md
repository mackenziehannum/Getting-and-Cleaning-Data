# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Coursera W4 Course Project
This is my submission for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" Week 4 Course Project. 

# Contents
1. R code - data cleaning for later analysis
2. Codebook
3. Tdy data set for the assignment.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
# Data
Information gathered from wearable computing, specifically the Samsung Galazy 5 smartphone. 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


# Generated R Script (run_analysis.R)

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
